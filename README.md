### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Asynchronous Programming**:
    
    - Explanation of synchronous vs. asynchronous operations.
    - Use cases for asynchronous logic, such as API calls and file operations.
    - Working with callbacks, promises, and async/await.
    - Understanding callback hell and the pyramid of doom.
2. **Callbacks**:
    
    - Writing functions that are executed after an asynchronous task completes.
    - Handling errors in callbacks and passing results as parameters.
3. **Promises**:
    
    - Creating and using promises to manage asynchronous operations.
    - Chaining promises to handle sequential asynchronous tasks.
    - Using `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` for promise handling.
    - Error handling in promise chains.
4. **Async/Await**:
    
    - Simplifying asynchronous code using async/await syntax.
    - Using try-catch blocks for error handling in async/await.
    - Understanding top-level await in modern JavaScript.
5. **Error Handling**:
    
    - Using `try-catch` for both synchronous and asynchronous code.
    - Throwing custom errors and handling them in a structured way.
6. **Node.js File System API**:
    
    - Using the callback and promise-based versions of the Node.js File System API.
    - Reading and writing files asynchronously with proper error handling.
7. **Event Handling**:
    
    - Using the EventEmitter in Node.js to listen for and emit events.
    - Examples of handling system events, mouse clicks, and keypresses.
8. **Global Promise Methods**:
    
    - Using `Promise.all`, `Promise.allSettled`, `Promise.any`, and `Promise.race` for managing multiple promises concurrently.
